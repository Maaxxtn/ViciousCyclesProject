        <h1>About Vicious Cycles</h1>
        <p>
          At Vicious Cycles we value community and experiences. We want to share
          the world of biking with you, whoever you are, so we established to be
          a different kind of bike shop. We strive to be a bike shop that
          provides a sense of community. We don't want to be just a place to
          shop at, but a place to trade, learn, make friendships, and hang out.
          Inspired to create events and community around cycling and bring back
          being in the present moment of a fast paced world that views growth as
          sales and not experiences.

      <p>
        Hang around and be sure to check out our extensive inventory online and
        inside the shop! We also offer maintenance services and provide easy
        pick up times and scheduling. Or, just stop by and have lunch or a
        coffee before, after, or, just a little break, in the middle of a
        lengthy ride.
